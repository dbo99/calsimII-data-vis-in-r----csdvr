# **:earth_asia: csdvr :earth_americas:** #
 free calsim data visualizer (post-processor) in R | 
 version 1.0_8.10.2018 | 
 analyze calsim output for large numbers of variables or scenarios | 
 export report or presentation ready plot images (jpgs, pdfs, etc) or interactive html plots  

   key file  | use
------------ | -------------
`csv_list.r` | list csv file names and give unique nicknames
`scen_facts.r` | give an order to plot scenarios in (ie left to right data/top to bottom legend)
`control.r` | main user interface - actually read-in data and analyze or batch export plots
`plotexport.r` | select which plot scripts to run for export (wait 1-2 minutes for a huge set or view some instantly?)
`fun_defs.r` | data summary/plotting function definitions

## Uses ##

- WRIMS2 CalSim decision variable ("DV") output in `.csv` format.
   If csv file(s) needed, enter in 2018 or later versions of WRIMS2's GUI's `Dvar DSS file:`'s field: `outputfilename.csv` instead of: `outputfilename.dss` (both will be created using `.csv` alone). WRIMS2 is free from California Dept. of Water Resources, see link at bottom for request - currently distrubuted via email list
- R, and R libraries specified in `libs.r`. Relies heavily on `dplyr` and `ggplot2` of the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

## To Use ##

**Download** `csdvr_date.zip` (~15.03 mb: ~15 mb of sample plots, ~30 kb of scripts)
   https://github.com/dbo99/csdvr----calsimII-data-vis-in-r/blob/master/csdvr_aug18.zip

**Drop** your calsim csvs in `csv` folder (or write there directly from WRIMS2)

**Open RStudio and files** by clicking on `control.r`, then open  `csv_list.r` and `scen_facts.r`

**Point to files and ID scenarios** in **`csv_list.r`**: enter each csv file name (eg `040812_bo_y1a1.csv`) and give unique nickname to each (eg `Scen1_Y1A1`)

**Specify plotting order of scenarios** (groupings to facilitate data vis): in **`scenfacts.r`** enter same nicknames in user-defined order: top to bottom in **`scenfacts.r`** produces top to bottom order in plot legend. Nickname spelling in **`csv_list.r`** must match **`scen_facts.r`**

`control.r`  | action
------------ | -------------
run-click `1` | **read in libraries,  functions, and csv data** (do first then sparingly as ~1/6 min read-in time per scenario) (~0.5 gb `.csv` each) (option to append in `csv._list.r`). 2a & 2b need 1 run first.
run-click `2a` | **generate plots in batches** with pre-defined templates for common DVs of interest -- call scripts of plots
run-click `2b` | **generate individual data summaries** (ie tabular as `tibble`,`.csv`) **or individual plots** for any DVs of interest by searching for DVs here and by running individual functions listed below

### notes ###
- above steps will export batches of plots. functions are listed below only for reference and new analysis.
- assumes DV name familiarity, eg Folsom Lake is `s8`. If not consult `.wresl` or `.dss` files.  `varcodes.csv` identifies some dvname-commonname pairs, add more as desired. By defaults plots label the `df$dv`, the actual CalSim name not the `df$dv_name`. For common name (if defined), add `+ facet_grid(~dv_name)` to plot function
- save new finished plot scripts in `plotexportscripts` folder to add to collection of templates & add folder in plots folder with name of new file name
- currently assumes all scenarios are under same climate scenario (tied to wyt.csv - adjustment needed to accomodate more for any water  year type functions - other functions still applicable as is if multiple climate scenarios used) (sample's uses Q5 Early Long Term)
- default plot size is widescreen to exactly fit default `.pptx`. To change, search and replace all (from Ctrl-F) `width = 13.333, height = 7.5`, to desired dimensions, eg `width = 10, height = 6` , same with desired filetype, eg `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.html`)
- tweaks needed in dates to work with CalSim 3.0's longer period of record
- currently lacks any diagnostics on system controls - hoping to add key controls directly in `.wresl` files for ease in csdvr and in other post-processors
- currently lacks any geospatial plotting
