# csdvr
 calsim data vis in r. version 1.0_8.10.2018
 
##### workflow #####

0. Requires `.csv` output (not `.dss`). Typing `.csv` instead of `.dss` in WRIMS' dv field produces both a `.csv` and `.dss` output decision variable "dv" file. Requires WRIMS
   versions from 2018 or later
1. Download csdvr_versiondate.zip as entire package to start from (33 kb) 
3. Drop your CalSimII csvs in `csv` folder (or CalSim 3.0 beta if just 1921 - 2003 range is OK)
2. In `csv_list.r`, enter your csv file names and give scenarios nicknames (ie plot labels; short labels give room for the plot)


4. If scenario order matters for on-the-fly plots or batch plots, enter same nicknames to `scenfacts.r`, in order you prefer (top to bottom here yields top to bottom in legend). Otherwise skip step; default order without `scenfacts.r` tweaks is alphabetic

5. In `control.r`: in three places at top, enter the working folder path (eg use as a stand alone post-processor location or in a project-specific folder?)

6. In `control.r`, run blocks from top down as needed: single run-clicks there let you read in csvs, build `data.frame`s, and either batch export `ggplot2` or `plotly` plots or see/export tables as `tibble`/`.csv`to examine certain decision variables (dvs)

#### notes #####
- assumes you know names of variables to search for, ie names of dvs, eg "s17". If not, consult `.wresl` or `.dss` files. wish-list: auto-completion of dv names while typing. `varcodes.csv` identifies some
- as needed enter other name/nickname descriptions for dvs in `varcodes.csv` - only a few mapped currently, eg `Jones (CVP)` for `d419`. some plots label the `df$dv`, the actual calsim name, and other `df$dv_name`, the nickname
- as needed/time allows save/generalize your working plots in plot scripts folder to add to collection of templates
- currently only handles one climate change scenario (ie tied to wyt.csv - adjustment needed to accommodate more)
- default plot size is widescreen powerpoint. to change, search and replace (ie Ctrl-F `width = 13.333, height = 7.5`, replace all with 
  desired dimensions, eg `width = 10, height = 6` and filetype, eg .jpg, .pdf)
