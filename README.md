 calsim data visualizer (post-processor) in R | analyze calsim output for large numbers of variables or scenarios | 
 export report or presentation ready plot images (jpg, interactive html, pdf, etc) | calsim is a california water resources planning model developed jointly by USBR and Ca-DWR for the [central valley project](https://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvp/) and [state water project](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/State-Water-Project) 

   key file  | use
------------ | -------------
[`csv_list.r`](https://github.com/dbo99/csdvr----calsimII-data-vis-in-r/blob/Aug15/csv_list.r) | list csv file names and give brief unique scenario nicknames
[`fun_defs.r`](https://github.com/dbo99/csdvr----calsimII-data-vis-in-r/blob/Aug15/fun_defs.r) | function definitions - add to as necessary
[`scen_facts.r`](https://github.com/dbo99/csdvr----calsimII-data-vis-in-r/blob/Aug15/scenfacts.r) | list nicknames top down to order the left to right position of scenarios in the plot (instead of alphabetic)
[`plotexport.r`](https://github.com/dbo99/csdvr----calsimII-data-vis-in-r/blob/Aug15/plotexport.r) | select which plot scripts.r to run for export (wait 1-2 minutes for a comprehensive set or a few seconds for 20 or so?)
[`control.r`](https://github.com/dbo99/csdvr----calsimII-data-vis-in-r/blob/Aug15/control.R) | main user interface - actually read-in data and analyze or batch export plots

## Uses ##

- WRIMS2 [CalSim]( https://water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Central-Valley-models-and-tools/CalSim-2) decision variable ("DV") output in `.csv` format.
   If csv file(s) needed, specify in 2018 or later versions of WRIMS2's GUI's field: `Dvar DSS file:`  `outputfilename.csv` instead of: `outputfilename.dss` ([.dss](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-dssvue/) and `.csv` will be created using `.csv` alone). [WRIMS2](https://water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Modeling-Platforms/Water-Resource-Integrated-Modeling-System) is free from California Dept. of Water Resources - currently distributed via email list
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and R libraries specified in `libs.r`. Relies heavily on `dplyr` and `ggplot2` of the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Instructions only tested with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) freeware

## To Use ##

[**Download**](https://github.com/dbo99/csdvr----calsimII-data-vis-in-r)  (~20.03 mb: ~20 mb sample plots, ~30 kb scripts)

**Drop** your calsim csvs in `csv` folder (or write there directly from WRIMS2)

**Open RStudio and files** by double clicking on **`control.r`**, then open  **`csv_list.r`** and **`scen_facts.r`**

**Point to files and ID scenarios** in **`csv_list.r`**: enter each csv file name (eg `040812_bo_y1a1.csv`) and give unique nickname to each (eg `Scen1_Y1A1`)

**Specify plotting order of scenarios** (groupings to facilitate data vis): in **`scenfacts.r`** enter same nicknames in user-defined order: top to bottom in **`scenfacts.r`** Nickname spelling in **`csv_list.r`** must match **`scen_facts.r`**

`control.r`  | action
------------ | -------------
run-click `1` | **read in libraries,  functions, and csv data** (do first then sparingly as ~1/6 min read-in time per scenario) (~0.5 gb `.csv` each) (option to append in `csv._list.r`). 2a & 2b need this (`1`) run first.
run-click `2a` | **generate plots in batches** with pre-defined templates for common DVs of interest -- call scripts of plots
run-click `2b` | **generate individual data summaries** (ie tabular as `tibble`,`.csv`) **or individual plots** for any DVs of interest by searching for DVs here and by running individual functions listed below

### notes ###
- `2a` will auto export batches of plots. functions are listed below for `2b`, for reference/new analysis/making new plot scripts
- assumes DV name familiarity, eg Folsom Lake is `s8`. consult `.wresl`, `.dss`, [schematic](http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/hydrology/CalSim/Downloads/CalSimDownloads/BST_CALSIMII_schematic_040110.pdf), or report files as needed.  `varcodes.csv` identifies some dvname-commonname pairs. add more as desired. By default plots label the `df$dv`, the actual CalSim name not the `df$dv_name`
- save new finished plot scripts in `plotexportscripts` folder to add to collection of templates & add folder in plots folder with name of new file name
- currently assumes all scenarios are under same climate scenario (tied to wyt.csv - adjustment needed to accommodate more for any water  year type functions - other functions still applicable as is if multiple climate scenarios used) (sample's uses Q5 Early Long Term)
- default plot size is widescreen to exactly fit default `.pptx`. To change, search and replace all (from Ctrl-F) `width = 13.333, height = 7.5`, to desired dimensions, eg `width = 10, height = 6` , same with desired filetype, eg `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.html`)
- tweaks needed around date functions and limits to work with CalSim 3.0's longer period of record
- needs functions for diagnostics on system controls (or add to`.wresl` directly)
- no geospatial plotting. planned for [CalSim 3.0](https://water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Central-Valley-models-and-tools/CalSim-3)'s channels and aquifers
  
# Functions
